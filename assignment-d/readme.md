####Title - Converging Worlds

I will be making an algorithmic video using various algorithms to generate abstract visuals along with the soundtrack. This visual will be midi reactive. I will create several sketches to segment different parts and sounds giving it different variations and types of visual textures. Having a midi controller to control the parameters, such as opacity and density, gives me more control over how the visuals are being moved or changed. It also helps me to affect the movements in real-time along with the soundtrack. 

Converging Worlds is an exploration into the sense of time based upon the measurement of time and our perception of time. I am interested in the constant struggle of processing time as a form of experience in relation to the universal form of telling time, in units of Seconds, Minutes and Hours. The dots and lines represents these units in isolated states, at times breaking apart and forming its own shape of time. I see these different sculptural forms as our individual perception of time and they are products of converging our understanding of time empirically with our own experience. 

The units of time forms Days, Months, Years and they are a measured concept of which a clock could not tell. It is the units for our perception of time and are much more complex in contrast to the basic workings of a clock. Their heterogeneous nature are told through the chaotic abstract forms of tangled webs, dense shapes overlapping in different opacities and visual velocities. 

In my exploration of sensing time through this work, of the struggle to converge the empirical and experiential states of time has caused me to lose my sense of time and eventually finding myself back into the hands of clock, the constant, which is the red line representing reality in the work.



###Reference

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55QU470oWrM> - Ryoichi Kurokawa This reference from Ryoichi Kurokawa is relevant to my work because the visuals are very unpredictable, and gives me a sort of suspense and tension that i want to apply to my work. The glitches are also relevant in what i want to achieve in my visuals.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPO7tXWVhc> - AOKI takamasa // rhythm variation 05 This reference is relevant in my work because in the sketch, there are two similiar visuals going on at the same time side by side, even though there is no clear line separating the two, it is very similiar to what i want to do in my video.
